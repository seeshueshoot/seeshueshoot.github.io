  <h2>Art For The Masses</h2>
  <p>Street art is insightful and irreverant, controversial and political, tolerated and banned.  Of course I love it!</p>

	<p>In 2019, I visited 48 cities and 22 countries in Europe.   But in 7 months of cultural exploration, I rarely stepped inside a museum.   I ADORE art, but I 
	hate lines, bag checks, and photography bans.  My pilgrimage taught me how to love street art, and now I look for it everywhere.</p>
	<p>If you really want to learn about a new place, I urge you to skip the museums and start with street art.  Most cities have local guides or companies that specialize in walking tours, or you can be your own guide and ask a local hostel or coffee shop to recommend a neighborhood. You can also do a simple Google or Instagram search using "street art" plus your location.  And yes, you can still visit those museums - just save them for rainy days.</p>
	<h3>13 Reasons Why I Love Street Art</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>coloful and inspiring</li>
	<li>always has a message</li>
	<li>no entrance fee</li>
	<li>no reservations, no lines</li>
	<li>no need to check my bags or coat</li>
	<li>not limited to particular "open" days and hours</li>
	<li>no photography restrictions</li>
	<li>street art is a scavenger hunt for active people - the treasure is there, you just have to look for it</li>
	<li>the sheer <em>abundance</em> of public places that showcase street art:  parks, bridges, alleys, steps, government buildings, parking lots, abandoned homes</li>
	<li>the vast scale - pieces as small my hand and as massive as a 10-story apartment building</li>
	<li>street art neighborhoods are usually off the beaten path, so I don't have to deal with crowds</li>
	<li>street art gives me insight into the people who live there and the things they value</li>
	<li>street art is dynamic and changes constantly (often overnight) - there's always something new to see</li>
	</ul>
