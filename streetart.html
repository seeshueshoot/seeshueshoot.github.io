  <h2>Art For The Masses</h2>
  <p>Street art is insightful and irreverant, controversial and political, tolerated and banned.  Of course I love it!</p>

	<p>In 2019, I visited 48 cities and 22 countries in Europe.   But in 7 months of cultural exploration, I rarely stepped inside a museum.   I ADORE art, but I hate lines, bag checks, and photography bans.  My pilgrimage taught me how to love street art, and now I look for it everywhere.</p>
	<p>If you really want to learn about a new place, skip the museums and hit the streets.  Most cities have local guides and companies that specialize in walking tours.  You can ask a local hostel or coffee shop to recommend a neighborhood.  Or you can do a simple Google or Instagram search for "street art" plus the location.  And you can still visit museums - just save them for rainy days.</p>
	<h3>15 Reasons Why I Love Street Art</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>the abundance of art that lives in public spaces is impressive - parks, alleys, staircases, government buildings, parking lots and walls of every size</li>
	<li>likewise the variety - pieces as small as my hand, murals as grandiose as a 10-story building</li>
	<li>it's coloful and inspiring</li>
	<li>it has a message</li>
	<li>street art is like a scavenger hunt for active people - you gotta go looking for it</li>
	<li>no entrance fee</li>
	<li>I can take unlimited photos, of whatever inspires me</li>
	<li>no need to make a reservation or stand in line</li>
	<li>consuming street art is not limited to certain days and times</li>
	<li>I don't have to check my bags or coat</li>
	<li>street art neighborhoods are usually off the beaten path, so I don't have to deal with crowds</li>
	<li>visiting these smaller neighborhoods supports local artists and businesses</li>	
	<li>and helps me learn the landscape and feel the essence of a place</li>
	<li>studying local street art gives me insight into the people who live there, and the things they value</li>
	<li>street art is dynamic and changes constantly (often overnight) - there's always something new to see</li>
	</ul>
